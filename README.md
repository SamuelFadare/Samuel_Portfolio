# [Project 1: A Data Science campaign with pandas and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/A%20Data%20Science%20campaign%20with%20pandas%20and%20PCA%2019059671.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire

*The project covers:
*Essential data wrangling with pandas;
*Working with different data types;
*Discerning categorical from numerical features;
*Spotting and interpreting the PCA 'variance bug';
*Working with a public data set.
*The "cars" data set was used, and It contains data on historic car models.
* A dataframe was built from this dataset, and their was a selection of numerical features from the categorical features 
*Categorical features were removed from the dataset
*A pca was done on the raw data, and a scatter plot was produced.
*A scree plot was thewn used to normalize and analyse how much variance is captured in the first two components.
*Covariance matrix was plot, and the features that are highly represented in the dataset was observed.
