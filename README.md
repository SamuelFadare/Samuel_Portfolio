# [Python Project 1: A Data Science campaign with pandas and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/A%20Data%20Science%20campaign%20with%20pandas%20and%20PCA%2019059671.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* Essential data wrangling with pandas;
* Working with different data types;
* Discerning categorical from numerical features;
* Spotting and interpreting the PCA 'variance bug';
* Working with a public data set.
* The "cars" data set was used, and It contains data on historic car models.
* A dataframe was built from this dataset, and their was a selection of numerical features from the categorical features 
* Categorical features were removed from the dataset
* A pca was done on the raw data, and a scatter plot was produced.
* A scree plot was thewn used to normalize and analyse how much variance is captured in the first two components.
* Covariance matrix was plot, and the features that are highly represented in the dataset was observed.


# [Python Project 2: Practical Visualisation and Analytics](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/A%20Data%20Science%20campaign%20with%20pandas%20and%20PCA%2019059671.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* practical visulaisation and analytics of the Iris dataset through the use of colormaps and colorbars.
* The brain dataset was also used he "Brain Networks" dataset which contains the activity of 62 brain regions of 920 time points. Neuroscientists are interested in the correlation between the activities in different brain areas. This tells them which brain areas are potentially connected. Such insight allows conclusions about how the brain works, which is at the heart of neuroscience. This project analysed the correlation between those time series.


# [Python Project 3: Modelling and predictions](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Modelling%20and%20Predictions.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* Practical tuning of classifiers using cross-validation and a hold-out test set. The Naive Bayes classifier is used, and it is trained in Scikit-learn. The standard one is the Gaussian variant, which assumes the data has a normal distribution. At the end of the project, the objective is to compare and select the best classifier with the highest accuracy.


# [Python Project 4: Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* Forecasting blog post, where the peculiarity of the project is to check the stationarity of a time series.
* Forecasting was also done using this Time Series
* The blog post uses an older version of statsmodels, where ARIMA was implemented differently. 


# [Python Project 5: First Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/FirstDeepLearningProject.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* The use of several libraries such as Keras (now built into TensorFlow), numpy, sklearn, and pydot for the purpose of Deep Learning. 
* Prima indians diabetes datasets and iris datasets were used as a case study while prediction was done on the dataset.


# [Python Project 6: Convolutional NEURAL Network](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb)

* This project demonstrates training a simple Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images with the use of Keras Sequential API. 
* The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. 
* The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 
* The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them. 
* The sizes of the test and training set is verified, before compiling and training the model.



# [Python Project 7: Completing a case study](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Completed_Case_Study.ipynb)

* This project analyses a case study 
* Pandas, numpy, tensorflow, and keras libraries were used for normalizing the training and test data, and modifying input parameters using the protodashEXPLORER 
* Heloc dataset was used for this analysis  
* An histogram was created to observe the distribution of values 
* The test set accuracy waas computed.
* Trained neural networks were used to complete the point
* Feature similarity was computed for each data point


# [Data Visualisation Project 1: Adventure Works dashboard](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Data_visualisation_Projects/blob/main/Adventure%20work%20visualisation.pdf)

* An impactful dashboard visualisation for adbenture works 
* The purpose of this visualisation is to show the organisation's BudgetAttribute over spreadout months.
* The purpose of this visualisation is to show the revenue generated from the organisation's categories which are Bikes, Acessories, and clothings.
* The purpose of this visualisation is to visualise the organisation's revenue, BudgetAttribute and variance for all categories and subcategories.
