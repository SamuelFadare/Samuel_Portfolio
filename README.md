# [Project 1: A Data Science campaign with pandas and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/A%20Data%20Science%20campaign%20with%20pandas%20and%20PCA%2019059671.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* Essential data wrangling with pandas;
* Working with different data types;
* Discerning categorical from numerical features;
* Spotting and interpreting the PCA 'variance bug';
* Working with a public data set.
* The "cars" data set was used, and It contains data on historic car models.
* A dataframe was built from this dataset, and their was a selection of numerical features from the categorical features 
* Categorical features were removed from the dataset
* A pca was done on the raw data, and a scatter plot was produced.
* A scree plot was thewn used to normalize and analyse how much variance is captured in the first two components.
* Covariance matrix was plot, and the features that are highly represented in the dataset was observed.


# [Project 2: Practical Visualisation and Analytics](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/A%20Data%20Science%20campaign%20with%20pandas%20and%20PCA%2019059671.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* This entails practical visulaisation and analytics of the Iris dataset through the use of colormaps and colorbars.
* The brain dataset was also used he "Brain Networks" dataset which contains the activity of 62 brain regions of 920 time points. Neuroscientists are interested in the correlation between the activities in different brain areas. This tells them which brain areas are potentially connected. Such insight allows conclusions about how the brain works, which is at the heart of neuroscience. This project analysed the correlation between those time series.


# [Project 3: Modelling and predictions](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Modelling%20and%20Predictions.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* The project entails practical tuning of classifiers using cross-validation and a hold-out test set. The Naive Bayes classifier is used, and it is trained in Scikit-learn. The standard one is the Gaussian variant, which assumes the data has a normal distribution. At the end of the project, the objective is to compare and select the best classifier with the highest accuracy.


# [Project 4: Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/SamuelFadare/Python_Projects/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb)

This is one of the Python projects i did during my Masters program at the University of Herfordshire, and it covers:

* The project is based on a forecasting blog post, where the peculiarity of the project is to check the stationarity of a time series.
* Forecasting was also done using this Time Series
* The blog post uses an older version of statsmodels, where ARIMA was implemented differently.
